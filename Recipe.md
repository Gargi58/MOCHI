# RECIPE
## Step 1: Cook Glutinous Rice (I decided to use a rice cooker method since it’s a standard electric appliance if you cook Japanese or Asian food frequently.)
### Rice Cooker: You do not need to soak the glutinous rice in water prior to cooking. Just rinse and cook the glutinous rice just like how you would cook regular steamed rice.

### Steamer: Traditionally, glutinous rice is steamed in a steamer because it’s considered the best way. You would rinse and soak the rinsed glutinous rice in water overnight, put the rice in a cheesecloth, place inside the steamer, and steam for 30 minutes.

### Instant Pot: You can use your Instant Pot if you have one. Soak the glutinous rice for 1 hour after rinsing, high-pressure cook for 5 minutes, and natural release for 15 minutes.

### Pot on Stove: Rinse the glutinous rice, soak for 10 minutes, then put the rice and water in the pot. Start with high heat, and once boiling, mix the rice once and put the lid on. Turn the heat down to the lowest heat and cook for 8-10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let it steam for 10-15 minutes.

## Step 2: “Knead” and “Pound” Using a Stand Mixer
### At this step, you will need a few things:
#### A KitchenAid® stand mixer – Professional series (This is the only appliance that I’ve tried making mochi successfully many times)
#### A timer (your smartphone would do)
#### Hot water ready for use
#### Silicone spatula (A flexible silicone spatula is easy to scrape down the mochi in the stand mixer)
#### A 2-cup measuring cup for soaking the spatula
#### This stand mixer process involves 2 stages:

#### “Knead” with a dough hook for 3 minutes – repeat 4 times [total 12 minutes]
#### “Pound” with a flat beater for 30 seconds – repeat 4 times [total 2 minutes]

## Step 3: Shaping Mochi Balls
### Here’s what you’re going to do:

#### 1. Thinly coat the mochi with potato starch (or cornstarch).
#### 2. Pull up a corner and tuck in the edges underneath to create a small mound. Keep pulling and tucking until it’s thick enough.
#### 3. Make a “C” with your well-dusted, left pointing finger and thumb, and then place the “C” fingers on top of the thick corner.
#### 4. Once you get a good-size ball shape that’s slightly bigger than a golf ball, pinch the mochi with your left “C” fingers. Use the right hand to twist it off.
#### When pinching, do not pull the mochi because the sticky surface would appear and your hands would get messy. Instead, use Pinch & Twist motion to cut the mochi with two “C” fingers and right hand. Make sure your hands are dry and well-dusted with potato starch.
#### 5. Quickly rotate the mochi on dusted hand to cover up the sticky new surface.
# REMINDER:

## Handle the areas dusted by starch only and make sure your hands are dry and well-dusted.
## Do not to “pull” the mochi, which creates a fresh sticky surface.
## If you see any sticky surface appearing on mochi, lightly dust a thin layer of starch and brush the excess away. Too much starch would be troublesome when you stuff the filling and close the mochi.


## Step 4 : Filling Mochi balls
#### 1. Place the mochi on a baking sheet and flatten it by pressing down.
#### 2. Brush off excess starch by hand or pastry brush.
#### 3. Place the filling in the centre of flattened mochi . (you can use different types of fillings , e.g. sweet red bean paste, ice-cream and many more )
#### 4. Pull up the sides of the mochi and seal it. ( Lightly dust your hands with potato starch then use a light pressure tp pinch and seal the mochi)
#### 5. At last , give it a nice round shape .
