# MOCHI
### Mochi is a Japanese rice cake made of mochigome, a short-grain japonica glutinous rice, and sometimes other ingredients such as water, sugar, and cornstarch. The rice is pounded into paste and molded into the desired shape. In Japan it is traditionally made in a ceremony called mochitsuki.
### Trust me, when I first heard about it, I was a bit skeptical. I mean, how good can it really be? I am pleased to inform you that it is, by far, one of the best desserts I have ever had. I would eat it every day if I could.
